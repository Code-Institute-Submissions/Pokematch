## Bugs

### Timer starts even if a difficulty Pokeball is not selected

### Sound effects too loud for some players

### Ball doesn't always match Sound

### By repeatedly clicking the same two pokemon that match, you can win without opening any other pokeballs. 

### When clicking off the difficulty ball, the answer is still stored so game starts on that setting if ball is toggled off and ball isn't highlighted.
